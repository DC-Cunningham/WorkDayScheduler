## Work Day Scheduler

# Project to utilise javascript, jquery and third party wep API's

The aim of this project was to create a browser window that could store a days planner. By utilising [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to provide the current time all hour block render as;

- red for previous hours,
- blue for the current hour,
- green for future hours.

By locking an entry the text is saved to the browsers local storage.
By pressing the trash icon the entry is cleared from the screen and also the local storage. This is only possible when the item is unlocked.
